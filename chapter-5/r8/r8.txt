the pop method in python takes an argument that indicates the index of the
value to be removed from the array. In the best case senario, the value at
the end of the array is removed thus, having a O(1) time complexity.
However at the worst case, the first value is removed, thus all of the values
after must be reindexed. The time complexity of the pop method should be
similar to that of the insert method. Overall the time complexity should be
O(n - k - 1), which n is the length of the array and k is the index.
